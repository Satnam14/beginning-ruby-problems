# Beginning Ruby Problems

- [x] [Tic Tac Toe](lib/TicTacToe.rb)
- [x] [Towers of Hanoi](lib/towerHanoi.rb)
- [x] [Permutations](lib/permutations.rb) - Given a string, return all of its permutations. Use recursion.
- [x] [Subsets](lib/subsets.rb) - Given am array, return all of it's subsets. Use recursion
- [x] [Knight's Travails](lib/knight_path_finder.rb) - Write a class that will find a path for a Chess Knight from a starting position to an end position
- [x] [Word Chains](lib/word_chainer.rb) - Given two words of equal length, build a chain of words connecting the first to the second. Each word in the chain must be in the dictionary and every step along the chain changes exactly one letter from the previous word.
- [x] [Binary Search](lib/binary_search.rb) - Given a sorted array and an integer, find the index of the integer inside the array. Do this without traversing the entire array
- [x] [Merge Sort](lib/merge_sort.rb) - Sort an array in nLogn time, where n is the length of the array. Use recursion
- [x] [Make Change](lib/make_change.rb) - Given an amount and an array of coins. How can a given amount of money be made with the least number of coins of given denominations?
- [x] [Fibonacci](lib/fibonacci.rb) - Return first n numbers in the fibonacci sequence. Both Iteratively and Recursively
- [x] [Exponentiation](lib/exponentiation.rb) - Implement exponentiation using multiplication and recursion only.
- [x] [Deep Dup](lib/deep_dup.rb) - Using recursion and the is_a? method, write an Array#deep_dup method that will perform a "deep" duplication of the interior arrays.
