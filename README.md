# Beginning Ruby Problems

## Games

- [x] [Tic Tac Toe](lib/TicTacToe.rb)
- [x] [Towers of Hanoi](lib/towerHanoi.rb)

## Arrays and Strings

- [x] [Permutations](lib/permutations.rb) - Given a string, return all of its permutations. Use recursion.
- [x] [Unique Substring](lib/uniq_subs.rb) - Write a method that finds all the unique substrings for a word
- [x] [Subsets](lib/subsets.rb) - Given am array, return all of it's subsets. Use recursion
- [x] [Binary Search](lib/binary_search.rb) - Given a sorted array and an integer, find the index of the integer inside the array. Do this without traversing the entire array
- [x] [Make Change](lib/make_change.rb) - Given an amount and an array of coins. How can a given amount of money be made with the least number of coins of given denominations?
- [x] [Fibonacci](lib/fibonacci.rb) - Return first n numbers in the fibonacci sequence. Both Iteratively and Recursively
- [x] [Exponentiation](lib/exponentiation.rb) - Implement exponentiation using multiplication and recursion only.
- [x] [Deep Dup](lib/deep_dup.rb) - Using recursion and the is_a? method, write an Array#deep_dup method that will perform a "deep" duplication of the interior arrays.
- [x] [Pair Sum](lib/pair_sum.rb) - Given an array of integers, return all pairs that sum up to a specified value k. List the pairs in [min, max] order.
- [x] [Silly Years](lib/silly_years.rb) - Write a function that takes a year (four digit integer) and returns an
array with the 10 closest subsequent years that meet the following
condition: the first two digits summed with the last two digits are
equal to the middle two digits. E.g.,

    1978 => 19 + 78 = 97
    2307 => 23 + 07 = 30

- [x] [Largest Contiguous Subsum](lib/largest_contiguous_subsum.rb) - Given an array of integers (positive and negative) find the
                                                                      largest contiguous subsum (sum of a subarray). Do this is O(n) time and O(1) space

## Trees

- [x] [Knight's Travails](lib/knight_path_finder.rb) - Write a class that will find a path for a Chess Knight from a starting position to an end position
- [x] [Word Chains](lib/word_chainer.rb) - Given two words of equal length, build a chain of words connecting the first to the second. Each word in the chain must be in the dictionary and every step along the chain changes exactly one letter from the previous word.

## Sorting Algorithms

- [x] [Merge Sort](lib/merge_sort.rb) - Sort an array in nLogn time, where n is the length of the array. Use recursion
